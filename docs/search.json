Now we could say that \\(\\beta_{3}\\) represent the change of \\(X_{1}\\) effectiveness associated with a one-unit increase in \\(X_{2}\\).\nIt very important that we keep hierarchical principle, which states that if we include an interaction in a model, we should also include the main effects, even if the p-values associated with their coefficients are not significant as it would alter the meaning of the interaction.\n\n1 quantitative and 1 qualitative variable\n\nIf \\(X_{1}\\) is quantitative and \\(X_{2}\\) is qualitative:\n\\[\n\\hat{Y} =\n\\begin{cases}\n    (\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{2}) + (\\beta_{1} + \\beta_{3})X_{1} & \\text{if }X_{2} \\text{ is TRUE}\\\\\n    \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X_{1}                             & \\text{if }X_{2} \\text{ is FALSE}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nAdding the \\(\\beta_{3}\\) interaction allow the line to change the line slope based on \\(X_{2}\\) and not just a different intercept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolynomial regression\nThis approach relax the linearity assumption that models usually have.

Ideally, the residual plot will show no discernible pattern.

Plot the residuals from our model as a function of time or execution order. If the errors are uncorrelated, then there should be no discernible pattern.   2. Check if some observation have been exposed to the same environmental factors\nGood experimental design is crucial in order to mitigate these problems\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-constant variance (heteroscedasticity) of error terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection method\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\nPlot the residual plot en check if you can see a funnel shape\nWe can transform the response using a concave function such as \\(\\log{Y}\\) or \\(\\sqrt{Y}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutliers\nAn outlier is a point for which \\(y_{i}\\) is far from the value predicted by the model.

Then search for points which absolute value is greater than 3\nThey can be removed if it has occurred due to an error in data collection. Otherwise, they may indicate a deficiency with the model, such as a missing predictor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-leverage points\nObservations with high leverage have an unusual value for \\(x_{i}\\). High leverage observations tend to have a sizable impact on the estimated regression line and any problems with these points may invalidate the entire fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection method\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\nCompute the leverage statistic. Find an observation with higher value than mean, represented by \\((p + 1)/n\\). Leverage values are always between \\(1/n\\) and \\(1\\)\nMake sure that the value is correct and not a data collection problem\n\n\n\n\\[\nh_{i} = \\frac{1}{n} +\n        \\frac{(x_{i} - \\overline{x})^2}\n              {\\Sigma_{i'=1}^n(x_{i'} - \\overline{x})^2}\n\\]\nIn a multiple linear regression, it is possible to have an observation that is well within the range of each individual predictor’s values, but that is unusual in terms of the full set of predictors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollinearity\nCollinearity refers to the situation in which two or more predictor variables are closely related (highly correlated) to one another. It reduces the accuracy of the estimates of the regression coeﬃcients and causes the standard error for \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{j}\\) to grow. That reduce the power of the hypothesis test,that is, the probability of correctly detecting a non-zero coeﬃcient.\nLooking at the correlation matrix of the predictors could be usefull, but it is possible for collinearity to exist between three or more variables even if no pair of variables has a particularly high correlation (multicollinearity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection method\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\nThe best way to assess multicollinearity is to compute the variance inﬂation factor (VIF), which is the ratio of the variance of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{j}\\) when ﬁtting the full model divided by the variance of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{j}\\) if ﬁt on its own with 1 as its lowest value and 5 or 10 as problematic values of collinearity\n1. Drop one of the problematic variables from the regression.   2. Combine the collinear variables together into a single predictor\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\text{VIF}(\\hat{\\beta}_{j}) = \\frac{1}\n                                   {1 - R_{X_{j}|X_{-j}}^2}\n\\]\nWhere \\(R_{X_{j}|X_{-j}}^2\\) is the \\(R^2\\) from a regression of \\(X_{j}\\) onto all of the other predictors.\n\n\n\nAvoid using for classification problems\nThere are better model to achieve that kind of situation. For example, he linear discriminant analysis (LDA) procedure the same response of a linear regression for a binary problem. Other reasons are:\n\nA regression method cannot accommodate a qualitative response with more than two classes.\nA regression method will not provide meaningful estimates of \\(Pr(Y|X)\\) as some of our estimates might be outside the [0, 1] interval."

This phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality, and it ties into the fact that non-parametric approaches often perform poorly when p is large. We will now investigate this curse.\n\n\nSuppose that we have a set of observations, each with measurements on p = 1 feature, X. We assume that X is uniformly (evenly) distributed on [0, 1]. Associated with each observation is a response value. Suppose that we wish to predict a test observation’s response using only observations that are within 10 % of the range of X closest to that test observation. For instance, in order to predict the response for a test observation with X = 0.6, we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65]. On average, what fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?\n\n\nlibrary(data.table)\n\nset.seed(123)\n\nUnifDistVar1 <-\n  data.table(sample = 1:1000\n  )[, .(x1 = runif(1000)),\n    by = \"sample\"\n  ][, .(prop = mean(x1 %between% c(0.6 - 0.1/2, 0.6 + 0.1/2))),\n    by = \"sample\"]\n  \nmean(UnifDistVar1$prop)\n\n[1] 0.100297\n\n\n\nNow suppose that we have a set of observations, each with measurements on p = 2 features, X1 and X2. We assume that (X1, X2) are uniformly distributed on [0, 1] × [0, 1]. We wish to predict a test observation’s response using only observations that are within 10 % of the range of X1 and within 10 % of the range of X2 closest to that test observation. For instance, in order to predict the response for a test observation with X1 = 0.6 and X2 = 0.35, we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65] for X1 and in the range [0.3, 0.4] for X2.

Again the observations are uniformly distributed on each feature, and again each feature ranges in value from 0 to 1. We wish to predict a test observation’s response using observations within the 10 % of each feature’s range that is closest to that test observation. What fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?\n\n\n0.1^100\n\n[1] 1e-100\n\n\n\nUsing your answers to parts (a)–(c), argue that a drawback of KNN when p is large is that there are very few training observations “near” any given test observation.\n\nAs p gets lager every point has more specifications to meet and the number of point which meet them decrease.\n\n\nWe now examine the differences between LDA and QDA.\n\n\nIf the Bayes decision boundary is linear, do we expect LDA or QDA to perform better on the training set?

Why?\n\nThe test prediction accuracy won’t change by increasing n, as that measure depends on the real shape of the Bayes decision boundary.\n\nTrue or False: Even if the Bayes decision boundary for a given problem is linear, we will probably achieve a superior test error rate using QDA rather than LDA because QDA is flexible enough to model a linear decision boundary. Justify your answer.\n\nFALSE, as QDA would model some noise that could affect the prediction accuracy.\n\n\nSuppose we collect data for a group of students in a statistics class with variables X1 = hours studied, X2 = undergrad GPA, and Y = receive an A.
